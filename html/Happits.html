            <h1> What was the project?</h1>
            <p>Happits is a small Christmas Break project. It is an app meant to help me establish new, productive habits. </p>
            <p>I used it as an opportunity to learn about Flutter and Dart, which I used to write the app for Android.</p>

            <h1>How does the app work?</h1>
            <p> Define a Habit by giving it a name, a duration and an interval. 
                The time to the next session will tick down. Start the activity for its entire duration for the Streak and total to count up. 
                Fail to start the activity and you will lose your streak.
