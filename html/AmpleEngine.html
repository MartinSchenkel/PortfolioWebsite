            <h1> What was the project?</h1>
            <p> AmpleEngine is what two of my classmates and me called our own custom 2D Game Engine that we were supposed to make a MegaMan X2 Clone upon. The engine is a pure Entity-Component System. I was responsible for the Physics, Gameplay Mechanics and Enemy AI. I also built the levels using our custom level editor tool. The engine was created in C++ from scratch.</p>
            <p> I worked on it for 8 Weeks in a team of 3 People: 1 Engine Programmer, 1 Graphics Programmer and me as the Gameplay Programmer </p>

            <h1> What did I learn from the project?</h1>
            <p> 
                This was the first project I worked on in a team with just programmers. Having to pick up the designer and artists tasks alongside my own was quite fun. I learned how to create and Engine and what an Engine actually is. I learned how to use our own Level Editor to create and save levels, how to use Box2D for a physics system, what an ECS is and how to work with it and how create the enemies.

            <h1> Creating the Enemies </h1>
            <p>You can see the enemies in the video above.</p>
            <p>The enemies I created were supposed to be exact copies of the ones you encounter in the beginning of Megaman X2. I took close reference of them and created them using my own FSM Structure. I created a Base AI with a basic interface that the enemies use to implement their actions in each state.</p>
            <p>Below is the code of this interface</p>
