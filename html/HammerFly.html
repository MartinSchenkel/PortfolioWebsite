            <h1> What was the project?</h1>
            <p>
                Hammer Fly is a personal project I worked on. I made it in Unity on my own. Some assets are from Kenney Assets and some are created by me. I developed it for Android and it is currently available on the <a href = "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.DefaultCompany.HammerFly" rel="noreferrer"target="_blank">Google Play Store</a>

            <h1> What did I learn from the project?</h1>
            <p> 
                This project was not the most challenging from a technical standpoint. However, it did teach me a lot about what it takes to publish an app. I also learned how to use Unitys Touch Input and how to serialize and deserialize things like score and settings to a device. I also researched Unity Ads and how to use them, but in the end decided not to put ads on the product.
