            <h1> What was the project?</h1>
            <p>This was one of my year one projects at University. We were tasked to create a 3D Real Time Strategy game set in space, that would run on the raspberry pi. </p>
            <p>We had 8 Weeks for this project, and it was done entirely in C++. We were given a small framework, but had to improve the renderer and such in order for it to run properly.</p>

            <h1> What did I learn from the project?</h1>
            <p>This project was the first time developing something for another target platform. I have never used a raspberry pi before, so getting used to that was an additional challenge. For the game, I took inspiration from Stellaris. I learned how to optimize your game so that it can run on devices with low specs, how to create RTS AI, how to create an UI System and how to make a UI/UX Plan.</p>

            <p>This is the Design Document that I created before starting to implement the game</p>
            <p>I tried to focus on what the player does and then create the systems I need from there. I think that I managed to come pretty close to the mockups in the actual game. I had a lot of fun making this document actually. I tried to be rather creative while still creating something that can be undestood by other people easily and show and justifiy the decisions I have made.</p>

            <h1>Creating the AI</h1>
            <p>My goal for the AI was to create an AI that would show a little bit of "personality". For this I made each AI have different values for Militaryfocus and aggressiveness and depending on those values it would play in different ways. The way the game works, is that you get a tax collecting vessel once you have more than 10 Planets in your system, these are really important as they are what gets you gold to buy other things. The AI will use its discovery vessels to explore and claim neighboring systems to reach that point as fast as possible. After that, the before mentioned values come into play. The AI will choose to do a MilitaryMove such as attacking an enemy, building a bigger fleet or moving the existing fleet or to do a more civil move such as moving or creating a discovery vessel. The Military Action it takes is decided by the aggressiveness value, more aggressive AI will search more confrontation and move their fleets aggressively, while less aggressive, military focussed AI's may choose to just build up a huge fleet for defense.  
            </p>
            <p>This was the idea for the AI. It never really worked, because of bugs with figuring out which systems are on the outside of its territory, which are already captured and which will be captured. Unfortunately I did not have enough time to figure those out, so the AI only really worked during the early game, where it is expanding to 10 Systems as fast as possible.</p>
