            <h1> What was the project?</h1>
            <p> This was a personal project I did, to learn more about machine learning. I used a genetic algorithm to teach an AI to play Tetris. I made this project from scratch using C++ and SFML for the rendering. I worked on it for around 10 hours not including the time to train the AI in total.</p>

            <h1> What did I learn from the project?</h1>
            <p> 
                Before starting working on this project, I learned a lot about Machine Learning, Genetic Algorithms, Deep Learning and Neural Networks.
            </p>
            <p>
                I decided to just use a simple genetic algorithm to teach my AI, as it seemed like a good point to start getting into machine learning and it was sufficient for what I wanted the AI to learn.

            <h1> The Results </h1>
            <img src="/Pictures/TetrisAIResults.png" width="100%"> <!-- TODO ADD ACTUAL FAKE FLOCKING GIF-->
            <p>
                I made the program print out the score of the best, the worst, the mediocre and average of all genomes. From that data I compiled this graph. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The trend of the graph is going up, with some minor inconsitencies. This was to be expected, as I change the seed of the Tetris Game every generation, as to get an AI that is good at playing Tetris and not one that is good at playing one specific game of Tetris.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unfortunately, the project is very poorly optimized so going through these generations took upwards of 10 hours, which is why I didn't train the AI any further. I am confident that this trend would continue and that my genetic algorithm works, though.

            <p>The genetic algorithm I created.</p>
            <p>After each generation, I delete the worst half of all genomes. I then use this "makeChild()" function to randomly combine two Genomes and possibly mutate them. </p>
            <p>Each Genome has 6 Parameters which are used to determine which move it will perform. The AI will evaluate all possible positions of the next piece and then evaluate the board using these parameters, choosing the one that gives the best score. Changing these parameters changes the AI behavior.</p>

            <h1> What would I improve? </h1>
            <p>There are a lot of things that I did not consider before I started this project, that I realized are crucial to making an AI. Most of all, the Debug AI and the printing of stats and genomes was an afterthought for me. If I was to do a project like this again, I will consider these things much earlier.</p>
            <p>As mentioned earlier, the project is also poorly optimized. Since each Genome evaluates each position of each piece, it is quite performance intensive and slow. I would try finding a to improve this, possibly using lookup-tables. I would also add a performance mode, where nothing would need to be rendered, which I also did not do. Lastly, I would try to use multithreading to train multiple Genomes at once instead of one after another. </p>
