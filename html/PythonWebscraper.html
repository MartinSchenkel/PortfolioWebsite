            <h1> What was the project?</h1>
            <p> This was just a fun side project for me. My and my friends were looking into creating a website for our "clan". For this, we wanted to display stats of our players in different games, so I decided to create a python webscraper to fetch those stats. </p>
            <p> You can look at the scraper source code on my <a href="https://github.com/MartinSchenkel/PythonWebscraper">Github. </a> </p>
            <p> You can see a WIP Display of the Stats (fetched by my scraper) on the image above. </p>

            <h1> What did I learn from the project?</h1>
            <p> 
                This was the biggest Python project I have ever done and I learned a lot about the Syntax and how to work with python.
            </p>
            <p>
                I made the program write the stats to Json and/or CSV so I learned how to write to those file formats properly.
            </p>
            <p>
                I learned what an "XPath" is and how to use it to find HTML Elements on a website using selenium. I learned how to write the XPath myself to keep it as short and as consistent as possible.
