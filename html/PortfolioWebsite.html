            <h1> What was the project?</h1>
            <p> I created this portfolio website using nothing but Vanilla HTML5 and CSS. </p>
            <p> You can look at the website source code on my <a href="https://github.com/MartinSchenkel/PortfolioWebsite">Github. </a> </p>

            <h1> What did I learn from the project?</h1>
            <p> 
                I learned a lot about Web Development. It is not something I have done before and something that was always like a blackbox for me. Through creating my portfolio website, I learned a lot about the web, different websites and about how to develop websites yourself.
            </p>
            <p>
                I enjoy learning a wide variety of things in a wide variety of topics and I am happy to have learned at least a little bit of Web Development.
