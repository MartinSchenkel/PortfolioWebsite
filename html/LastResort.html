            <h1> What was the project?</h1>
            <p>This is the project I worked on for my third year of University. It is an online Co-op base defense shooter.</p>
            <p> I worked on it in a big team of 29 People: 2 Producers, 1 Audio Designer, 4 Game Designers, 4 Level Designers, 2 Animators, 2 Riggers, 1 Prop Artist, 4 Character/Environment Artists, 2 Network Programmers, 1 Physics Programmer, 1 Generalist Programmer and 3 AI Programmer </p>
            <p> We created the game in Unreal Engine using Blueprints and C++. My responsibilities were AI Programming.</p>
            </p>
            <p>
                The game is set to release on Steam, first in Early Access and then by the end of the academic year as a full release. You can see the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1491650/Last_Resort/">Steam Page here.</a>
