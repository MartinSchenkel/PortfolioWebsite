            <h1> What is the project?</h1>
            <p> Histera is the first IP from the Indie Game Studio StickyLock. I am working on it during my 40 Week internship. It is the first commercial project that I am working on and I am learning a lot and having a blast. We are using Unity DOTS to develop this online multiplayer shooter, which is a great learning opportunity for me!</p>
            <p> My Responsibilities include fixing bugs (Everything from small cosmetic bugs to client and server crashes), improving performance of certain areas and systems and updating and even implementing new features, for example the new UI! </p>
            <p> I am very greatful to StickyLock for giving me the opportunity to work on a project like this. </p>

            <h1> Biggest Learning Points </h1>
            <p> 
                My biggest learning point is definitely hwo to work in Unity and especially with Unity DOTS. This is by far the biggest unity project I have worked on.
                The internship is also helping me learn how to work in a company on a commercial project like this. I am learning something new every day and I am having a great time working at StickyLock!
