            <h1> What was the project?</h1>
            <p>This project was what I wanted to make (but did not mange to) for my intake assignment to get into Breda University of Applied Sciences. It's a 2D Action Game, in which you can only defeat the enemies by reflecting their attacks back at them. This requires a big amount of hand-eye coordination and I can confidently say that I am bad at my own game.</p>
            <p>
                My goal for this project was to publish it to <a href="https://maddisch.itch.io/refense">Itch.io</a> at the end. This was to force me to actually finish a project for once instead of abandoning it before the polishing phase.
            </p>
            <p>
                The game is open-source and you can find the source code <a href="https://github.com/MartinSchenkel/Refense">Here on my Github. </a>

            <p>
               This was the first time I tried to write shaders. I had no experience and learned a lot reading the <a href="https://thebookofshaders.com/">Book of Shaders</a>
               <br>
               After that, I was able to write the Shader you see above. I think it works nicely with the overall feel of the game and I am quite happy with it. However, I realized that writing shaders is not a passion of mine. I see the potential there is and how much cool and incredible stuff you can make with it, but it is not hooking me.

            <img src="/Pictures/RefenseParticleSystemModuleOffset.gif" width="100%">
            <p>For this game, I wanted to be able to create cool VFX, as I think those can really get your game onto another level.</p>
            <img src="/Pictures/RefenseParticleSystemGravityPointFire.gif" width="100%">
            <p>The 2D Sprite Particle System that I created was inspired by Unreal Engines Cascade System. Each Particle System consists of any number of Emitters, which spawn and move the particles themselves. This allows for some really cool VFX. </p>

            <h1> Menu </h1>
            <img src="/Pictures/RefenseMainMenu.gif" width="100%">
            <p>I also needed to add a good menu, that allows you to change settings, such as Audio and Keybinds, as well as look at the credits and start/quit the game. For that I created multiple UI Elements (Buttons, Sliders, Scrolling Text etc.) that I reused throughout the different menus.</p>
            <img src="/Pictures/RefensePauseScreen1.gif" width="100%">
            <p>I was also able to reuse the Settings screen in the pause menu and it works really well. I learned how to get an AppData Path to save the settings in, which is how most games seem to do it. </p>

            <h1> AI </h1>
            <img src="/Pictures/RefenseEasyMode1.gif" width="100%">
            <p>For the AI, I went simple. Basically what they do is they move to a random X-Coordinate, jumping in semi-random intervals and shooting a projectile in semi-random intervals. This turned out to be fun and challenging enough and showed me that a Fun AI does not have to be a Smart AI.</p>
