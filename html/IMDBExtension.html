            <h1> What was the project?</h1>
            <p> This was just a fun side project for me. I found myself wondering what the average rating was for shows/movies Adam Sandler has played in. I took that opportunity to learn how to build a chrome extension. </p>
            <p> I use the Chrome Extension functionality to detect whether or not I am looking at a persons IMDB page and if so, I look for the credits. If the person has credits as an Actor/Actress, Writer, Producer or Director, I loop through all credited shows using Javascript html scraping functionality, and make an API call to OMDB, which then returns a rating for that show. I then calculate the average and inject it into the html code.</p>
