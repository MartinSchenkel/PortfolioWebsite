            <h1> What was the project?</h1>
            <p> DIY Hero was the last of my year one projects at Breda University of Applied Sciences. It is a cute top down game, in which you play as a little boy who has to fight a vegtable boss.</p>    
            <p> I worked on it in a team of 9 People: 2 Designers, 4 Artists, 1 Musician and 2 Programmers </p>
            <p> We created the game in Unreal Engine using only Blueprints. My responsibilities were Gameplay Programming. More Details below. </p>
            <p> This game was featured in the Unreal Engine Student Showcase Spring 2020 </p>
            <p> Unfortunately this game was never published so I cannot provide you with a download link </p>

            <h1> What did I learn from the project?</h1>
            <p> 
                This game was the first time working in a team with other people. I learned quite a bit about Project Structure and how to work together as a team. I created the dynamic camera system, worked with Unreal Behavior Trees for the first time when prototyping the boss (the final boss was implemented by someone else), set up Animation Blueprints and learned how to use Skeleton Sockets to attach different weapons and have them follow the animation. </p>

            <h1> Dynamic Camera </h1>

            <p>A gif showing the Camera</p>
            <p>When you first hit the boss, the camera transfers from following mode to combat mode. Designers were able to define a position it should lerp to and the camera would lerp to that position and rotation. In combat, the camera zooms in and out and changes center depending on the position of the boss and the player so that you get that dynamic camera look that shows you just what you actually want to see. In the end the player can walk through the gate that has opened, which triggers another nice camera zoom that I created.</p>
            <p>Bellow is a sticker we made to promote our game during Play Day. We made one sticker for each member of the team and this one is mine, "carrying" the camera.</p>
